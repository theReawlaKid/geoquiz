
Geography Quiz

Brief: An extension project to use recently gained knowledge
from Treehouse courses. Specifically:
    -   OOP with JavaScript. (Creating objects and prototypes,
        accessing and manipulating properties, using prototypal
        inheritance)
    -   AJAX Basics. (Updating a page with an AJAX request, using
        JSON formatted data)
    -   Responsive web design (using media queries to alter layout
        and adopting a mobile-first approach )

Plan: To extend the basic 5 question quiz to:
    - allow a user to choose a topic
    - show correct or incorrect when answered and wait for
      button click before moving to next question
    - show scores in real time
    - include picture questions
    - structure so that it will be easy to incorporate a more
      complicated scoring system in the future, and or differentiated
      quizzes for different target grades.
    - use AJAX to retrieve data for each quiz in JSON format
 
Structural plan:
Objects:
        - QuizUI (a user interface object with all necessary methods to
                  play each quiz and switch topics, calculate score, etc)
        - Quiz ( x 12 --- 1 for each topic)
        - Question (abstract parent object)
            - Qpic (picture questions)(inherit from Question)
            - Qtext (text questions)(inherit from Question)
            
HTML:
        - Header with title and current topic 
        - A starter page div with instructions and topic buttons
        - A Quiz page div with questions and answers
        - A Footer with progress data and score
            
Functionality:
        When the page loads, you should see the starter page div and
        be able to select a topic. selecting a topic will hide the
        starter div and display quiz page. On finishing a quiz you
        should be able to retake the quiz or return to start to select
        another topic.
